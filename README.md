# Ship Detection- Project AIRBUS 2019
The purpose of this project is to detect small ships from various satelite images. 
First, we need to train a CNN to detect all ships from the image.
Then, we need to classified those ships to highlight small ones. 

The train set is composed by 196000 images. One image is in color and his dimension is 780x780 pixel. 
The test set is composed by 30 000 images in color and with the same dimension.
